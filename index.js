// Write your code here
const num1 = 2
const num2 = 31
var multiply = num1 * num2 
//multiply the variables num1 and num2 whose results will equal "62".

let random = Math.ceil(Math.random() * 10)
//enerate a random integer greater than 0.

const mod = 12/3
//set to an equation whose remainder is equal to "4
let max = Math.max(10, 20, 2, 4)

//at will return "20" as the highest number in the set
